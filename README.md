<h3 align="center">A blog to share my knowledge and grow in my career!</h3>

<h2>Why another blog in millions? ðŸŒ </h2>

<br/>
My main goal is not to compete with anyone, there are many excellent blogs out there like KentCDodds or Overreacted from Dan Abramov. I want to share what I know in a simplified way and even grow in my career.
<br/>

<h2>Why just not write on medium? ðŸ“œ</h2>
<br/>
Creating a blog and managing such a big project can also contribute to my knowledge and my career, so why not torture myself? ðŸ˜„

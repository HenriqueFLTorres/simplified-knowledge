</Warning>

If for some reason you've tried comparing <CodeFragment>objects</CodeFragment> or <CodeFragment>arrays</CodeFragment> in JavaScript, you probably went confused by why they weren't the same even having an identical value/content.. <br/>

This happens because JavaScript compares non-primitive types with their <Highlight>reference</Highlight> and not their actual value, and not knowing that, can cause a headache.

### Copy by Value <br/>

Primitive data types like <CodeFragment>String</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Number</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Boolean</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>undefined</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>null</CodeFragment>, are tagged as <Highlight>Value</Highlight> types, because, when we throw its information or value in some other variable, this new variable will copy its value.

See the following example.

```js
let 🍎 = "Apple"
let 💰 = 0

let 🍏 = 🍎 // "Apple"
let 👜 = 💰 // 0

console.log(🍏 === 🍎) // true
console.log(👜 === 💰) // true

```

When comparing the new variables using <CodeFragment>console.log()</CodeFragment>, it will return <CodeFragment>true</CodeFragment>, because JavaScript compares the primitives according to their content.

### Copy by Reference

On the other hand, the non-primitives, <CodeFragment>Arrays</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Objects</CodeFragment>, and <CodeFragment>Functions</CodeFragment>, are tagged as <Highlight>Reference</Highlight> types. Because, when we define a new variable with its information, this new variable will have its reference and not its value.

<br />
See the following example

```js
const 🚗 = [💺, 💺, 💺, 💺]
const 🚓 = [💺, 💺, 💺, 💺]
const 🚘 = 🚗

console.log(🚓 === 🚗) // false
console.log(🚘 === 🚗) // true
```

Let's go back to some lines in the text <Highlight>"this new variable will have its reference and not its value"</Highlight>. But, if it won't have the value, how did javascript manage to compare the 🚘 with 🚗? And why does 🚓 when compared to 🚗, JavaScript tell us that it's "different"? <br/>

The answer is simple, comparison by <Highlight>reference</Highlight>! Primitive data types are copied and compared by value, and non-primitive ones are copied and compared by reference. <br/>

So knowing the difference between <Highlight>reference</Highlight> and actual <Highlight>value</Highlight> is critical for learning advanced hooks in React like <CodeFragment>useEffect()</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>useCallback() </CodeFragment> and <CodeFragment>useMemo()</CodeFragment>.

### Ok, but what is Reference?

References are addresses allocated in your computer's memory, and when we compare two non-primitive pieces of information, for example, an <CodeFragment>object</CodeFragment>, JavaScript compares its memory address and not its contents. Let's see one more example.

```js
const 👩‍⚕️ = {
  name: "Bia",
  age: 28
};

const 👩‍🍳 = 👩‍⚕️;

console.log(👩‍⚕️.name); // Bia

👩‍🍳.nome = "Patricia";

console.log(👩‍⚕️.name); // Patricia
console.log(👩‍🍳.name); // Patricia
```

When we set the name of 👩‍🍳 to Patricia, the name of 👩‍⚕️ also changes! That's because the content of 👩‍🍳 is a <Highlight>reference</Highlight> to the content of 👩‍⚕️, so whatever changes there are in any reference to the <CodeFragment>Object</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Array</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment >Function</CodeFragment> the original one will be affected.

### Why knowing this is important?

If you've been using React for a while, we have several hooks and features that help our program's performance, and an important one is the <CodeFragment>useEffect()</CodeFragment>'s dependency array. If you put an array or object as a dependency, your page will not work correctly, and that's because <CodeFragment>useEffect()</CodeFragment> is comparing non-primitives with their <Highlight>reference</Highlight>. <br/>

Another example is the <CodeFragment>useCallback()</CodeFragment>, used to memorize functions and not just compare with their reference, preventing the creation of another identical function on every rendering. If you want a post talking about it, let me know!

### <Highlight>Remember!</Highlight>

    • Value types are Primitives and copied by their value. <br/>
    • Reference types are non-primitives and are copied by their reference. <br/>

• When comparing identical non-primitives, they return <CodeFragment>false</CodeFragment> because their <Highlight>reference</Highlight> type. <br/>

• Value types → <CodeFragment>String</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Number</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Boolean</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>undefined</CodeFragment> and <CodeFragment>null</CodeFragment>. <br/>
• Reference types → <CodeFragment>Array</CodeFragment>, <CodeFragment>Object</CodeFragment> and <CodeFragment>Function</CodeFragment>.

We can say that middlewares are, <Highlight>Functions that run between the `request` object
and an application's `response`</Highlight>. With them, we can run any
code during this process, terminate the <Code>response</Code> or even modify the
<Code>req</Code> and <Code>res</Code> objects.

### Writing a simple Middleware

Let's write a function called <Code>simpleMiddleware</Code> as our middleware,
and after that, we'll use <Code>app.use(simpleMiddleware)</Code> for our <Code>app.get('/')</Code> to access it.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const simpleMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware working!");
  next();
};

app.use(simpleMiddleware)

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

When we access <Code>http://localhost:3000/</Code> we will get the message <Code>"Middleware working!"</Code>.
Note that we will not receive the <Code>console.log()</Code> in the browser, Node.js runs on the <Highlight>V8 Engine</Highlight> of the
JavaScript and does not have access to our browser!

### Using a Middleware: Global

In the example above, we use <Code>app.use()</Code>, if we happen to have more routes in this file, Middleware
will be used in all, hence called global usage. It is important to note that they are called in the order they are defined.
See the example:

```js
...

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
});

app.use(simpleMiddleware)

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>About Page!</h1>");
});

...

```

Our Middleware will only be called if someone is already accessing the page <Code>http://localhost:3000/About</Code>, the main 
page will be ignored. Global usage can be useful when organizing routes by files and types!

### Using a Middleware: Route

If you want to use it by route, you can add the Middleware name between the <Code>req</Code> and <Code>res</Code> objects.
see the example

```js
...

app.get("/", simpleMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
});

...
```

or like this


```js
...

app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
});

...
```


### Middleware Preference: Global vs Route

Know that when we use <Code>app.use(middleware)</Code>, it has a higher preference than the route one, that is, it will be called first.


```js
app.use(myGlobalMiddleware)

app.get("/about", myRouteMiddleware, (req, res) => {
res.send("About page")
});

// myGlobalMiddleware is called
// myRouteMiddleware is called
```

### Communication between Middlewares

We can pass information between Middlewares by modifying its <Code>req</Code> and <Code>res</Code> objects. 
See the example

```js
const authorizeMajorAge = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.age >= "18") {
    authorized.req = true;
    next();
  } else {
    res.send("ERROR: You are a minor");
  }
};

app.get("/", authorizeMajorAge, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`<h1>Main page <br/> Authorized = ${authorized request} </h1>`);
});
```

When accessing with <Code>http://localhost:3000/?age=18</Code>, the Middleware authorizes us to have the necessary requirements, and soon after, renders
the page with the message: Authorized <Code>true</Code>.

<PostImage image={messageEN} description="" />

### Avoid errors using Middlewares

In the previous examples, we used a <Code>if</Code> and <Code>else</Code> to determine if the user is a minor or not,
but what if we want to "shorten" the code with the intention of making it cleaner? The first thing someone thinks about is leaving it like this:

```js
const authorizeMajorAge = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.age >= "18") {
    authorized.req = true;
    next();
  }
  res.send("ERROR: You are a minor");
};
```

express runs code even after <Code>next()</Code>, so the user would be authorized and then get an error!
As annoying as it is, this way that express uses in Middlewares opens up another opportunity for us to run some code after the
<Code>response</Code> object.
